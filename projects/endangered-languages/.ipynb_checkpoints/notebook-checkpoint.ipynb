    "### Additional Challenges\n",
    "Another goal of this project was to push the boundaries of the various map projections that I had come to know and use in previous projects for the course. Ultimately, I ended up using the `d3.geoOrthographic()` and `d3.geoChamberlinAfrica()` projections for my two maps. I chose to map Africa as a standalone content purely due to the fact that it had it's own projection available. This brought up a challenge with how to best display data, however. Due to the large number of points, it didn't make sense to continue to plot points not on Africa, and that proved to be true for the GeoJSON and TopoJSON data as well. Therefore, I came up with the following solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Basemap (again) and a custom Africa GeoJSON map file.\n",
    "2. Load the same map file in both Python on Basemap, and also using d3.js.\n",
    "3. Loop through the languages in Python and discard any not within the bounds of continental Africa.\n",
    "4. Save to a new CSV called `endangered-languages-africa.csv`."
