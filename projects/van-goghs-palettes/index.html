    <h1>Van Gogh&rsquo;s Palettes</h1>
    <p>The five most dominant colors from 913 of Vincent van Gogh&rsquo;s oil and watercolor paintings. Images and metadata were sourced from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Vincent_van_Gogh' target='_blank'>this Wikpedia list</a>, which is available under a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights' target='_blank'>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a> license. Data was scraped and processed using Python, with help from <a href='http://blog.zeevgilovitz.com/detecting-dominant-colours-in-python/' target='_blank'>this blog post on finding dominant image colors</a>. The algorithm uses <a href='http://charlesleifer.com/blog/using-python-and-k-means-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-images/' target='_blank'>K-Means clustering</a> in order to extract the <em>n</em>-most dominant colors (I ran it for the top five).</p>
    <p>This was an initial data exploration into the <b>possible</b> trends and/or associations between van Gogh&rsquo;s color in his work and <a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/05/van-gogh-and-mental-illness/' target='_blank'>&ldquo;anguishing mental illness â€” frequent episodes of depression, paralyzing anxiety and, according to some accounts, the symptoms of bipolar disorder.&rdquo;</a> This data could be used to tell a story through the conceivable subconscious evolution of his work.
